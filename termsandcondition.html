						<p>Bitro Softwares provides the Dedicated Hosting Service that is subject to the following
							agreement. Dedicated hosting in this terms and conditions refers to both VPS (Windows and
							Linux) and dedicated servers. In case of a difference in terms applying to VPS and dedicated
							server on a single subject, VPS or dedicated term is pointed out. When signing up for a
							Dedicated hosting account with the Bitro Softwares , the Customer agrees to abide by the
							rules and provisions explicated in these Dedicated Terms of Service, as well as all their
							coherent policies mentioned herein. The Customer of our Services should also be aware that
							when signing up for a Dedicated server hosting account with Bitro Softwares , he/or she
							agrees to position data on our servers and make it accessible to the wide internet public.
							In this respect, the Customer understands and agrees that it is beyond the power of Bitro
							Softwares to restrict any public access to this data and guarantee the security of the
							Customer’s files. The Customer, therefore, is completely in charge of protecting his/her web
							content on our Dedicated servers and should consider carefully each piece of information
							before uploading it to his/her newly allocated Dedicated server space. We highly recommend
							that Customers avoid publishing online personal data that could be abused.</p>
						<h3>I. SERVICE AGREEMENT; ENTIRE AGREEMENT
						</h3>
						<p>The Provider shall provide its Services to You – the Customer – under the Terms and
							Conditions explicated in this Service Agreement. The Agreement is intended to keep the
							integrity of both Bitro Softwares and the Customer and to protect both parties from
							liability. This Service Agreement will be enforced to ensure the speed, power, performance,
							and reliability of our Services. The Service Agreement and any other policies or agreements
							mentioned in this document, constitute the whole act of convention between Bitro Softwares
							and the Customer.</p>
						<h3>II. RULES FOR ACTIVATION AND MONTHLY PAYMENT BASIS OF THE DEDICATED SERVER HOSTING SERVICE
						</h3>
						<p>Upon submitting of the online order form, the Customer agrees to abide by our Order
							Verification Policy and the following provisions:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>The payment of the Dedicated server hosting service is set up on a monthly basis. The
								Customer agrees to pay for the rendered Dedicated server hosting services in advance for
								each monthly service term.
							</li>
							<li>Non-Payment of the service shall result in a immediate service disconnection. Customers
								failing to secure payment by the time of the due date will incur service interruption.
								The data hosted on the Dedicated server will be kept for 8 days, after that it will be
								permanently deleted.
							</li>
							<li>Setup fees and monthly service fees are non-refundable. The Customer agrees to a
								no-refund policy in advance.</li>
						</ol>
						<h3>III. SERVICE GUARANTEES; DATA BACKUP</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>SERVICE GUARANTEES The Provider guarantees 99.9% network uptime and server stability.
								This, however, does not refer to problems stemming from:
							</li>
							<li>Server Hardware Breakdown;
							</li>
							<li>User error(s) or purposeful interruption(s) of the user service (e.g. if the client
								shuts his/her own server down, Bitro Softwares is not responsible for the downtime);
							</li>
							<li>Failure due to software that is not explicitly supported by Bitro Softwares. If a
								hardware crash provoked by the Customer consequently happens, the Provider is beyond the
								control and responsibility for the resulting downtime.
							</li>
							<li>DATA BACKUP Due to the specificity of the Dedicated server hosting service, providing
								Customers with fully independent and self-managed hosting environment, the DATA BAKCUP
								of all Customer’s website contents and databases is solely Customer’s responsibility, as
								well.
							</li>
						</ol>
						<h3>IV. SERVICE ACTIVATION AND CONTINUANCE TIMESCALES</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>SERVICE ACTIVATION For newly signed up clients – the Services are activated only after
								our Sales Department gets in touch with the Customer over the phone to verify the
								payment details (this is required due to the high fraud activity spreading online, and
								in order to be prevented fraudulent account usage). The payment verification procedure
								is obligatory and if we fail to approve a transaction within 48 hours of the payment
								submission, the funds will be credited back to the payer and the order will be canceled.
								For existing customers – the services for existing Customers, including upgrade services
								and renewals, are activated immediately after our Sales Department receives the
								according service payment.</li>
							<li>
								SERVICE Delivery Bitro Softwares commits to deliver services in consideration of
								delivery time mentioned for each product on our website. We are not obliged to provide
								any information in regard of a service delivery status or prioritize a service delivery
								unless the commitment time has been passed. To be specific and to prevent further
								confusion, delivery time for Windows VPS is up to 24 hours. For Linux VPS the delivery
								is instant once billing status is changed to completed. For dedicated servers, the
								delivery varies from 1 business day to 5 business days. Customer is responsible to check
								delivery time of each product/service we offer on our website. In case of unexpected
								events such as power outage that might delay delivery time of a service/product, Bitro
								Softwares is entitled to put maximum effort to satisfy customer by for example
								prioritizing the order but that would not entitle customer to cancel or refund for
								example dedicated servers which once are under process, are not refundable.
							</li>
							<li>CONTINUANCE TIMESCALES Dedicated Server Accounts – The newly-created Dedicated server
								hosting accounts with the Provider are valid for 1 month. They can be renewed on a
								monthly basis, i.e. for another month that will be added to the official expiration date
								of the Dedicated server account. CANCELLATION, REFUND & MONEY-BACK; CHARGEBACKS</li>
							<li>
								CANCELLATIONS In order to cancel a Dedicated server account, the Customer must send a
								support ticket to the Provider’s Sales Department via his/her Dedicated management
								account and provide any authentication credentials requested by Bitro Softwares. Any
								other form of cancellation request will not be accepted.
							</li>
							<li>REFUNDS VPS and Dedicated server hosting accounts – The VPS and Dedicated server
								accounts are set up on a monthly prepay basis. Customers may cancel their accounts at
								any time, however they will not be entitled to a refund for the unused period of the
								prepaid month, since these services do NOT include Money Back Guarantee. Any incentives
								offered to the Customers upon sign-up will be also canceled. VPS hosting, on the other
								hand, is entitled to 7 day money back guarantee. Customer needs to request for the
								refund only through the first 7 days after the service is delivered by email. Limited
								accounts may not be approved for a refund request as that would provide a loophole in
								the system for abusive purposes. In addition, no refund is approved if the costumer use
								the service for illegal things. Each customer and account is limited to request for
								refund only one time. Approve or reject of a refund request for a customer is under the
								sole direction of Bitro Softwares and may not be appealed.</li>
							<li>CHARGEBACKS Chargebacks are not considered as a way of refunding. Any Customer who
								initiates a credit card chargeback in response to a bill or order placed with Bitro
								Softwares will be subject to full investigation. When signing up for a Dedicated server
								hosting account with Bitro Softwares, the Customer agrees to the terms and conditions
								explicated in this document (and its coherent policies). Thus, Bitro Softwares, as well
								as Bitro Softwares’s authorized retailers, will resort to these documents as an evidence
								for the Customer’s agreement, especially in the event that a Customer sends a chargeback
								inquiry based on points that he/or she first accepted, but is trying now to refute.
								If/When a chargeback report is received, the first step of Bitro Softwares’s Customer
								Care team will be to try to contact the Customer. Meanwhile, the Customer’s Dedicated
								server account will be suspended (in order to protect our system from fraudulent
								activity and misuse) and will remain suspended until the reasons for the chargeback have
								been clarified and decision has been taken for according action. If the chargeback has
								occurred due to some misunderstanding, a reverse payment procedure will be initiated
								with the authorized retailers and eventually the Dedicated server account will be
								re-activated. If the Customer has sent a chargeback request based on groundless
								argumentations (according to Bitro Softwares’s own judgment and these Dedicated Terms of
								Service), then a dispute will be started with the authorized retailers in which the
								Dedicated Terms of Service of Bitro Softwares will serve as evidence of the Customer’s
								agreement. The retailers then, taking into consideration all provisions in these legal
								documents, will decide whether the Customer has had sufficient grounds for the
								chargeback or Bitro Softwares has the right to a reverse payment. In case that the
								chargeback originates from a fraudulent user (end-client) and no reverse payment
								procedure can be activated, then the respective Dedicated server account will remain
								suspended. Please consider that all fees of Licenses through Bitro Softwares’s services
								are non-refundable.</li>
						</ol>
						<h3>V. HOSTING RESELLER TOOLS</h3>
						<p>A collection of free hosting reseller tools: a free domain reseller account is available with
							each Dedicated Server hosting package. All bonuses are given per customer’s request.</p>
						<h3>VI. CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITIES; ACCOUNT REGISTRATION AND MANAGEMENT
						</h3>
						<p>In consideration of their use of the Service, Customers agree to:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Provide true, accurate, current and complete information about themselves as prompted by
								the registration form of the Service. Maintain and promptly update their registration
								data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If the Customer provides any
								information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Bitro Softwares
								has reasonable grounds (at its sole discretion) to suspect that such information is
								untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Bitro Softwares has the right to suspend
								or terminate the Customer’s account and refuse any and all current or future use of
								Bitro Softwares (or any portion thereof). If untrue details are used in order to avoid
								VAT the customer can be held responsible by the respective national tax collecting
								agency.
							</li>

								Bitro Softwares in the course of 10 business days after the changes become valid even
								though we are automatically notified by the system and all changes are registered and
								accessible. The introduction of changes should be done online through the customers’
								Dedicated Management Account, not via e-mail.</li>
							<li>Customers will receive a password and account designation upon completing of the
								registration process of the Service. Customers are responsible for keeping the
								confidentiality of their passwords and accounts, and are fully responsible for all
								activities that occur under that password or account. Customers agree to: a) immediately
								notify Bitro Softwares about any unauthorized use of their password or account or any
								other breach of security; b) ensure that they safely exit (log out from) their account
								at the end of each session. Bitro Softwares cannot and will not be liable for any loss
								or damage of account information arising from Customer’s failure to comply with this
								provision.
							</li>
							<li>If a Dedicated server hosting account is registered with details different than those of
								the person who paid for the account, and in the case of any dispute, Bitro Softwares
								will take the side of the person who paid for the account and shall not provide access
								to any other person, since – a hosting account owner is and will be considered to be the
								credit card /PayPal account holder.
							</li>
							<li>The client is obliged not to delete the provider’s SSH key, which provides root access
								to the server. The root access will be used by the provider in 2 cases only: 0. When
								there is a problem with the server and, as a result, certain services do not run
								properly – the provider may fix it as he sees fit.</li>
							<li>
								When there is a report from a third party concerning some sort of abuse, for example,
								spam, the provider can suspend or close the service immediately.
							</li>

								software for trying to illegally access another hosted machine or network. Customers may
